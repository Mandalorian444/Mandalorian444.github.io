description: To track some of my personal expenditures and help with budgeting, I decided to make a little app in C++ to track the prices of items I frequently purchase and get some more programming practice.  <a href="https://github.com/Mandalorian444/MPT" target="_blank">View this project on Github.</a>
notes:
 - Pop-ups make it simpler to add items and entries, edit said items and entries, and other such oft-repeated tasks.
