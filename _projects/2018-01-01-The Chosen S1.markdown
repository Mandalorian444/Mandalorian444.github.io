description: A lot of VFX work was needed to bring this story to life.  Our team was priviledged to do a lot of this work on the first season.
notes:
 - In this shot, the distant city was provided by the 3D team, but all the comp work (tracking, object/people removal, synthetic reflections) was my responsibility.
 - Bluescreens were used in many shots as well as tracking markers.  Tracking markers had to be removed and bluescreens needed to be replaced by our 3D environments.
