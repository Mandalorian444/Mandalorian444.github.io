description: The Immersive Bible app includes various items from Jerusalem that can be viewed in AR.  I was responsible for optimizing the geometry of each object and creating textures for them.
notes:
 - The props needed to retain as much detail as possible.  A careful balance needed to be struck between real geometry and textures to make sure the models would load on the average mobile device in a reasonable amount of time.
 - The original models we received had a very high polygon count that needed to be reduced and unwrapped for texturing.
