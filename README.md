Portfolio website for Tyson Benard
=========================

A small display of some of the projects I've worked on over the years.  I will occasionally add more and hope to also add other content such as blog posts of interesting things I've learned along the way or useful resources.

=========================

Visually based on the Jekyll theme [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/), which was used previously but has since been replaced.
