description: Making cool renders of Star Wars things is a lot of fun, so I make sure to do it from time to time.  The frame and 'Star Wars' text was generated with geometry nodes based off the camera settings and position, and the crystal was also generated with geometry nodes.  Other minor details such as dings and scratches were done procedurally.  The lightsaber was hand modeled based on a real one and procedurally textured.
notes:
 - Part of the fun of making these is trying to do all of it in Blender.  In this image, the stars were created using geometry nodes and the planet was a procedural texture on a flat plane.
 - Going off what reference I could find short of buying a replica, I modeled this E-11 for 3D printing purposes.  When all the internals are modeled, it makes for really cool translucent renders.
