description: Light moving through the scene was a regular effect in this film.  In this scene, I was responsible for adding various light effects which required careful masking and a simple 3D reconstruction of the room.  This allowed the light to accurately move across the objects in the room while avoiding as much tedious rotoscoping as possible and reduce time needed for changes.
