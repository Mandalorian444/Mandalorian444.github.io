description: Light moving through the scene was a regular effect in this film.  In this scene, I was responsible for adding various light effects which required careful masking and a 3D reconstruction of the room.  This allowed the light to accurately move across objects in the room while avoiding as much tedious rotoscoping as possible and reducing time needed for changes.
