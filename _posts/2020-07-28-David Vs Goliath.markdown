description: DvG is a VR game.  One of the goals was to make sure it could run on minimal hardware, such as the Oculus Quest.  This tent serves as the menu and trophy area for the DvG VR game.  I was tasked with laying out the props and environment, as well as optimizing models and textures in this scene.
notes:
 - This is a pack that a sheep carries in the game.  I was responsible for reducing the polygon count for this model and creating textures so it would have a minimal memory footprint and be very performant on the target platforms.
